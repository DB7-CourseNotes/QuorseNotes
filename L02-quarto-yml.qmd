title: "The `_quarto.yml` file"
---

Let's go through the file line-by-line.

```yml
date-fromat: iso
date: "last-modified"
author: "Dr. Devan Becker"
institute: "Wilfrid Laurier University"
```

- `date-format` to `institute` are self-explanatory.
    - See [date formats](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html) for more advanced things

```yml
execute:
  warning: false
  cache: true
  freeze: auto
```

- The `execute` options will apply to everything.

```yml
profile:
  default: slides
  group:
  - [slides, book]
```

This is where a lot of the magic happens! The profiles allow for easy switching between output formats, each of which has their own option.

- The default profile being "slides" means that `Ctrl+Shift+K` will preview to slides!
    - You can change this depending on what you're developing.
