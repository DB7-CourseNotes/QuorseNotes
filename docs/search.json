This is because I use VSCode to make my slides, and Cmd-Shift-K will build according to the _quarto.yml file. This means I prototype my notes as slides, then just kinda assume that the book will look good."

False\n\n&lt;!--- B ---&gt;\nI use a custom R script to find a string like the last one, and it extracts the answer and makes a question that can be uploaded to my LMS. The questions are just of the format “Q1: A, B, C, or D?”, so the students answer in the LMS but only see the actual questions on the slides. This is specific to the way I do things, but it has saved quite a bit of time and lets me do quizzes tied to their student numbers without an external tool."
