This is because I use VSCode to make my slides, and Cmd-Shift-K will build according to the _quarto.yml file. This means I prototype my notes as slides, then just kinda assume that the book will look good.\nThe _quarto-book.yml has a special name. The -book part tells quarto that it’s part of the “Book” project."

If you use this, you should change the name, institution, and email in the definition!\naspectratio and toc (table of contents), are beamer specific settings.\ninclude-in-header uses a custom \\(\\LaTeX\\) definition file for spacing in books versus slides. See below.\nexecute makes figures the right size for 16x9 slides. It also makes echo false by default (the book uses true by default).\n\n\n\nFor include-in-header: defs_beamer.tex, I use two special commands to make sure that I can control spacing in the slides and the book separately. In slides, I want to add spacing between lists. The \\lspace command is defined as \\newline if the file is executed without profile --book, and it’s defined as nothing if the profile is set to book. Similarly, \\pspace adds a space between paragraphs if the book is rendering to slides and does nothing for the book."
