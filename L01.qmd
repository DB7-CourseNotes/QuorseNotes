## Slides-first mentality

`_quarto.yml` assumes that the format is going to be `beamer` slides. This is because I use VSCode to make my slides, and Cmd-Shift-K will build according to the `_quarto.yml` file. This means I prototype my notes as slides, then just kinda assume that the book will look good.

The `_quarto-book.yml` has a special name. The `-book` part tells quarto that it's part of the "Book" project.

## Rendering the Book

```sh
quarto render --profile book
```

Alternately,

```sh
quarto preview --profile book
```

## Conditional Render by Project

The following allows for different content in the slides versus the book.

```
::: {.content-visible when-profile="book"}
Content here will only be visible when rendered using --profile book
:::
```

```
::: {.content-visible unless-profile="book"}
Content here will only be visible when **not** rendered using --profile book
:::
```

Notice that both of these are defined in `.vscode/quarto-bookslides.code-snippets`, and thus can be easily inserted when editing with VSCode (I'm not sure of an equivalent workflow in RStudio, but I'm sure it exists).


## Publishing on GitHub

The `_quarto-book.yml` file puts the book in the "docs" folder, and GitHub allows you to serve a static site from the `docs/` folder. The `output-dir: docs` in `_quarto-book.yml` is required!

On GitHub, go to Settings -> Pages and tell it to serve the site from `docs/`. 

That's it! There are no other steps to getting your book as a github website! You're done!
