# Setup Justification

## Slides-first mentality

`_quarto.yml` assumes that the format is going to be `beamer` slides. This is because I use VSCode to make my slides, and Cmd-Shift-K will build according to the `_quarto.yml` file. This means I prototype my notes as slides, then just kinda assume that the book will look good.

## Rendering the Book

```sh
quarto render --profile book
```

Alternately,

```sh
quarto preview --profile book
```

## Conditional Render by Project

```
::: {.content-visible when-profile="book"}
Content here will only be visible when rendered using --profile book
:::
```

## Publishing on GitHub

The `_quarto-book.yml` file puts the book in the "docs" folder, which is a required name! GitHub allows you to serve a static site from the docs page.
